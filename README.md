# LGMVIP-TASK-NO.7-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-
In this project, we aim to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is to train the classifier on a given dataset, in this case, the Iris dataset, and then use it to predict the class of new data based on the learned patterns from the training set.
